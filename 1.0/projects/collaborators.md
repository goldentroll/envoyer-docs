# Collaborators

[[toc]]

## Overview

Collaborators can be added to projects to help manage projects and deployments. Note that collaborators are not permitted to invite additional collaborators or delete a project.

:::tip Collaborators don't need to have a paid subscription

You can invite collaborators to your project who do not have a paid plan. This means that your company or team only need one active subscription to Envoyer.

## Inviting Collaborators

On the project's **Collaborators** tab, you can click the **Add Collaborator** button. Envoyer will present you with a modal asking for the e-mail address of the collaborator you wish to add. The email address must belong to a registered Envoyer user.

:::warning Project Owners

Only project owners are able to manage project collaborators.
