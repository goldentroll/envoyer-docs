# Notifications

[[toc]]

## Overview

Envoyer can optionally notify you after a deployment completes and whether it's deployed successfully or not. Configured notification channels will also be used by Envoyer's Heartbeat and Healthcheck services.

## Channels

You can configure multiple channels:

- Slack
- Email
- Discord
- Microsoft Teams

After you've selected a channel, you'll be asked to provide a name for the channel, webhook URL or email address. Once you've finished, click **Add Channel** to confirm.
